## Prerequisites

* Python 3.7 or higher
* A Discord server for which you have the rights to add a bot
* An Aternos account



## Getting Started

Visit the [wiki](https://github.com/kozabrada123/Aternos-On-Discord-Update/wiki) for info on installing and getting started.

## Usage:

### Discord Commands:
* --launch - starts the server
* --status - displays info about the server
* --help - displays commands


## Cloud Hosting Note

*Cloud hosting this bot would require some workarounds as Aternos recognizes you are connecting from a data center and prompts for a captcha test.* - Original note from Mekolaos, now still aplies but wouldn't work anyway as I'm not sure if you can run non headless in servers
