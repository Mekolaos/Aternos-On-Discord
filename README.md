  - [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
  - [Getting Started](#getting-started)
    - [Windows/Mac/Linux (x64)](https://github.com/kozabrada123/Aternos-On-Discord-Update/wiki/Windows---Mac---Linux-(x64)-Setup)

  - [Cloud Hosting Note](#cloud-hosting-note)



## Prerequisites

* Python 3.7 or higher
* A Discord server for which you have the rights to add a bot
* An Aternos account (**Which you *may* need to be comfortable being banned, don't use the account that owns the server**)



## Getting Started

Visit the [wiki](https://github.com/kozabrada123/Aternos-On-Discord-Update/wiki) for info on installing and getting started.

## Usage:

### Discord Commands:
* --launch - starts the server
* --status - displays info about the server
* --help - displays commands


## Cloud Hosting Note

*Cloud hosting this bot would require some workarounds as Aternos recognizes you are connecting from a data center and prompts for a captcha test.*

Note: There is undetected_chromedriver which *could* work, but it isn't supported on Arm / RPi so I'm not officially supporting it.
